# Changing-thoughts-into-diaogue
This repository contains the Altium PCB design for a project that we had in which we had to convert thoughts into audible dialogue.

There is a report attached alongside the actual files associated with the design that contains all the restrictions that were to be taken into account while designing the said PCB.

Please do not copy and paste the files as they are and make sure to email me first at - anmolyadav0106@gmail.com if you need to talk about importing certain parts of the project.
